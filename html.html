  <p id="storyText">The story behind these wonderful treats begins years ago when my great-great-great-grandmother
    was sitting on her little fishing boat on Lake Washington. She all of the sudden had an incredible craving for
    cookies. She thought to herself, "I would do anything for a cookie right now, I would even eat a..." Right
    then she felt a tug on her fishing line interuppting her train of thought and she reeled in the biggest salmon
    she had ever seen. A lightbulb went off in her head and she made her way home as fast as she could and got
    baking the most innovative, revolutionary desert all time, Salmon cookies! They're sweet, they're savory,
    heck, sometimes you even get a bone! But that's part of the charm! A family recipe passed down for generations
    made for all to enjoy, these cookies will really reel you in! Have one today at one of our many successful
    locations! </p>
