      <h2 class=story>The Story  </h2>
      <p class=story>The story behind these wonderful treats begins years ago when my great-great-great-grandmother was sitting on her little fishing boat on Lake Washington when she all of the sudden had an incredible craving for cookies. She thought to herself, "I would do anything for a cookie right now, I would even eat my shoe if it were a cookie, I would even eat a..." Right then she felt a tug on her fishing line interuppting her train of thought and she reeled in the biggest salmon she had ever seen. A lightbulb went off in her head and she made her way home as fast as she could and got baking the most innovative, revolutionary desert of possible all time. Salmon cookies! They're sweet, they're savory, heck, sometimes you even get a bone! But that's part of the charm! A family recipe passed down for generations made for all to enjoy, these cookies will really reel you in! Have one today at one of our many successful locations!  </p>
